SineSweeper ideas:

Allow for several different types of waveform
*sine (done)
*pulse / analog pulse
*triangle / analog triangle
*sawtooth / analog sawtooth

To do this, I have to: 
*create an abstract superclass of a "player"
*subclass the player for all types
*hook it into the interface

Allow for several different types of frequency modulation
*sawtooth/ramp
*exponential ramp (done)
*pulse
*triangle
*sawtooth
*constant

To do this, I have to:
*subclass the player for the remaining types
*fill a modulation buffer with a slave player at the desired modulation rate
*hook it into the interface

Could even modulate the frequency modulation...
